# Astronomical Image Processing

**This is a project based on image processing and analysis over fits data.
The fits data contains images of stars and comets.**

## Working part
- We have done pre-processing of fits file to get the files which have stars.
- We have come up with a clustering algorithm which helps to build the stars and comet based on the intensity.
- Finally we have done the analysis over comets data to analyze the zet like effect of comets.

## Technology and Libraries Used:
* Python
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Astropy


## Tools Used:
* Jupyter Notebook
* Google Colab


## Dataset Used
* I have particularly added the stars fits file and comets fits file for processing. 

* Dataset has been mentioned in the separate folder. I have particularly taken a fits file for each time and then preprocess and analyze which will be further applied to all the data files.
